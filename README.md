# 6502 CPU Breadboard Project

This repository contains the documentation and resources for building a functional 6502 microprocessor on a breadboard. The 6502 was an 8-bit microprocessor widely used in many home computers and game consoles in the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as the Apple II, Commodore 64, and the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional 6502 CPU using discrete logic chips and components on a breadboard. This hands-on approach provides a deeper understanding of the inner workings of a classic microprocessor and its underlying architecture.

## Repository Contents

- `Docs/`: Contains detailed documentation, including schematics, component lists, and assembly instructions.
- `Pictures/`: Contains detailed documentation, including schematics, component lists, and assembly instructions.
- `Schematics/`: Includes useful resources, such as datasheets, reference materials, and programming examples.
- `Software/`: Contains sample programs and test code for verifying the functionality of the 6502 CPU.
- `scr/`: Contains sample programs and test code for verifying the functionality of the 6502 CPU.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need the following:

- A large breadboard
- Various logic chips (e.g., 74LS series)
- Assorted electronic components (resistors, capacitors, LEDs, etc.)
- Power supply
- Basic electronic tools (soldering iron, wire cutters, pliers, etc.)

Refer to the `docs/` directory for detailed schematics, component lists, and step-by-step assembly instructions.

## Usage

Once you have assembled the 6502 CPU on the breadboard, you can use the provided software in the `software/` directory to test its functionality. This includes sample programs written in 6502 assembly language, as well as test routines to verify the correct operation of various instructions and addressing modes.
